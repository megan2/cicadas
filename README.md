## Executive Summary

The emergence of Brood X periodical cicadas in 2021 is an exciting and widespread event.  What makes this year unusual is the geographic range that this Brood covers: periodical cicadas

Does the presence of these insects lead to unusual human activity, perhaps driven by irritability and distraction?



## Biological Context for the Data

Colleagues and friends who have experienced an emergence of periodical cicadas indicate that the noise they make is unparalleled, and that it is more than possible to have an unwelcome physical encounter with a cicada.  This sounds like a potentially distracting and disruptive phenomenon (not to mention annoying to those who are not filled with wonder by these bugs).  

At first glance, it would seem that getting data for this topic would be difficult, due to the number of years between emergence events.  However, through the process of learning about cicadas, it became clear that even though we refer to them as “13-year” or “17-year” occasions, that reference is very location-specific! Nearly every year, there is a population (“Brood”) emerging somewhere on their unique 13 or 17-year lifecycle.  This is what will allow me to analyze the impact to human behavior: where available, I will look at city-level data for the years prior to, during, and following a periodical cicada emergence.  

## Motivation
Having never personally experienced cicadas on such a scale, I'm very curious about these insects and their emergence patterns across the country.  

## Data Questions
If we compare activity within the same timeframe before, during, and after the year of a periodical cicada emergence, can we observe any trends?  More specifically:
 - Are people more likely to misbehave during periodical cicada emergences, as evidenced by non-traffic citations and crime?
 - Is there an increase in traffic fatalities?
 - Does the populace demonstrate signs of
